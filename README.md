## Overview of the Analysis
### Purpose of the Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer, especially the top 10 bacterial species found to be present in their belly buttons via bacteria culture. This can help the potential volunteers see for themselves which bacteria species they have in their belly button and if need be, volunteer to give that species up to research and development labs. 

### About the Dataset:
The data is read from an external data file (JSON), and by using the D3.js library and a local server. 

### Tools Used:
HTML

JavaScript

### Description of the Analysis:
The analysis aims to visualize each test subject's data - demogrpahic as well as data related to the bacteria present in their belly button. It will do so by creating charts that show top 10 bacteria cultures found, bacteria cultures per sample, and belly button washing frequency (scrubs per week).

## Results
The options are showcased in a dropdown menu wherefrom the user can select the particular Test Subject ID against which they wish to have the data visualized.

The data is visualized in a panel and three charts. The panel shows demographic information related to the Test Subject. The horizontal bar chart shows the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) for an individual's ID. The bubble chart shows the bacteria cultures per sample, i.e. the different bacteria IDs and their respective sizes in the sample that was cultured.

The gauge chart shows the belly button washing frequency in terms of number of scrubs per week.

## Summary
The user friendly page enables the user, a potential volunteer, to visualize the top 10 bacteria found within their belly button, and thereby decide if they fit are able to volunteer any species that a research or manufacturing lab may require.
